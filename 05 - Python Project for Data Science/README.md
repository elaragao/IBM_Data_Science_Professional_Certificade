# Python Project for Data Science

## Summary :memo:
This mini-course aims to demonstrate basic Python skills for working with data. This course primarily involves completing a project in which the role of a Data Scientist or Data Analyst was assumed and a real-world dataset and a real-world inspired scenario was used to identify patterns and trends.

Specific data science and data analysis tasks were performed, such as data extraction, web scraping, data visualization and creating a dashboard. This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in Python and using libraries such as Pandas and Beautiful Soup in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Main Topics :clipboard:
 - Play the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working on a real project.
 - Demonstrate your Skills in Python. 
 - Apply Python fundamentals, Python data structures, and working with data in Python.
 - Build a dashboard using Python and libraries like Pandas, Beautiful Soup and Plotly using Jupyter notebook.

## Key Skills Learned :key:
 - Apply the skills of the previous courses to a project with real data
 - Use technologies like Jupyter and GitHub
 - Use libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Beautiful Soup, Seaborn and Plotly
