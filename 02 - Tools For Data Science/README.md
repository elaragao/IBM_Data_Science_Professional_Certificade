# Tools For Data Science? 

## Summary :memo:
This is the second module of the course, and promotes knowledge in the use of tools that Data Science professionals need. This course teaches you about popular tools in data science and how to use them.

Information was studied about the Data Scientist's toolkit which includes: Libraries and Packages, Datasets, Machine Learning Models, Kernels, as well as the various open source, commercial, Big Data and cloud-based tools.

In addition, the IDEs Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterLab, RStudio IDE, Git, GitHub and Watson Studio were presented. It was discussed what each tool is for, which programming languages they can run, their characteristics and limitations.

This course gives you a lot of hands-on experience to develop skills for working with these data science tools. With tools hosted in the cloud at Skills Network Labs, you can test each tool and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R, or Scala.
