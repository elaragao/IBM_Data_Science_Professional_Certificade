# Data Science Methodology

## Summary :memo:
In this module, the methodology that can be used to tackle any data science scenario will be presented and used. Two notable data science methodologies were explored, the Basic Data Science Methodology and the six-stage CRISP-DM data science methodology.


## Main Topics :clipboard:
 - From Problem to Approach and From Requiriments to Collection
 - From Understanding to Preparation and From Modeling to Evaluation
 - From Deployment to Feedback and Final Evaluation


## Concepts :mag:
The concepts covered below will be: Basic Data Science Methodology and the six-stage CRISP-DM
### Basic Data Science Methodology
 1. **Understanding the business**: Before beginning any analysis, it is crucial to understand the business goals and needs to ensure that data science efforts are aligned with organizational goals.
 2. **Analytical approach**: Determine the most appropriate analytical approach to solve the problem at hand. This may involve the selection of modeling techniques, algorithms and evaluation metrics.
 3. **Data requirements**: Identify the types of data needed to solve the problem and where that data can be found. This can include structured, unstructured, internal or external data.
 4. **Data collection**: Acquire the data identified in the previous step, ensuring it is clean, complete and ready for analysis. This may involve integrating multiple data sources.
 5. **Understanding data**: Explore and understand data through descriptive analytics and visualizations. This helps identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in data.
 6. **Data preparation**: Prepare data for analysis through cleaning, transformation, selection, and feature engineering. This ensures that the data is ready to be fed into machine learning models.
 7. **Modeling**: Develop predictive or descriptive models based on prepared data. This may include selecting and tuning machine learning algorithms, as well as model validation.
 8. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of developed models using appropriate metrics. This helps determine whether the models meet the success criteria defined in the analytical approach step.
 9. **Deployment**: Deploy the approved templates to a production environment for ongoing use. This may involve integrating the models into existing systems and monitoring performance in real time.
 10. **Feedback**: Collect feedback from end users and the system in production to continually iterate and improve models. This closes the data science loop, allowing models to be refined based on new data and experience.

### CRISP-DM
 1. **Business Understanding**: At this stage, project objectives are defined in terms of business goals and customer requirements. It is important to understand the business context and determine how data mining can help achieve these goals.
 2. **Data Understanding**: Here, available data is collected, explored and described. This involves identifying data sources, analyzing their quality, and initially understanding their characteristics. The goal is to become familiar with the data and identify potential problems or patterns.
 3. **Data Preparation**: In this step, data is prepared for analysis. This may include data cleaning, selection of relevant variables, data transformation, and integration of different data sources. The goal is to create a dataset ready for modeling.
 4. **Modeling**: Here, modeling techniques are selected and applied to the prepared data. This may involve building predictive models, descriptive models, or other types of models, depending on the goals of the project. Various models are evaluated and refined to find the best performance.
 5. **Evaluation**: In this phase, the developed models are evaluated to determine their effectiveness in solving the business problem. This involves evaluating the model's performance on a test or validation dataset and interpreting the results obtained.
 6. **Deployment**: Finally, the evaluated and approved models are deployed in an operational environment. This may involve integrating the model into existing systems, developing user interfaces, or automating the decision-making process. The goal is to ensure that the benefits of data mining are realized in practice.
