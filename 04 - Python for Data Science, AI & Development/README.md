# Python for Data Science, AI & Development

## Summary :memo:
This is the fourth module of the course, and covers the fundamentals of Python and the different types of data. Python data structures like lists and tuples were introduced, as well as logical concepts like conditions and branches. Here, Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Beautiful Soup were applied. Tasks such as data collection and web scraping with APIs were also carried out.

These technologies were practiced and applied in Jupyter Notebooks. Basic programs were created, working with data and automating real-world tasks using Python.
