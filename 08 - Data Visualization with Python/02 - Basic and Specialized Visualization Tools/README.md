## Basic Visualization Tools

### Area Plot
Area Chart: is a visual representation of data in which the **area below a line is filled with solid colors to highlight the magnitude of a metric over time or another 
independent variable**. These charts are especially useful for showing the cumulative distribution or overall trend of a time series. They can be employed in a variety 
of contexts, from visualizing sales over months to representing changes in temperature over decades. Area charts provide an intuitive and impactful representation of 
data, allowing for easy comparison between different categories or series.


 ### Histogram
A histogram is a type of bar chart that represents the **frequency distribution of numerical data**. It divides data into intervals called "bins" and shows how often 
values fall within each interval. Each bar in the histogram represents a range of values, and the height of the bar indicates how often the values fall within that 
range. Histograms are commonly used to visualize the distribution of continuous data such as age, height, temperature, etc.

 ### Bar Plot
 A bar chart, or Bar Chart, is a visual representation of data using rectangular bars of different lengths or proportional heights to represent values. Each bar 
 generally represents a **category of data and the height of the bar is proportional to the value it represents**. Bar charts are mainly used to compare the values of 
 different categories of data or to show changes in values over time. They are an effective tool for visualizing categorical data in a way that is easy to understand 
 and interpret.



## Specialized Visualization Tools

### Pie Charts
A pie chart, or Pie Chart, is a visual representation of data that shows the **proportion of each category in relation to the whole**. It consists of a circle 
divided into slices, where each slice represents a category of data and the size of the slice is proportional to the percentage or fraction of the total that 
that category represents. Pie charts are useful for highlighting parts of a whole and showing the relative distribution of categories.


### Box Plot
A Box Plot, also known as a box diagram, is a graph that summarizes the **distribution of a set of numerical data**. It shows the median, quartiles, minimum and 
maximum values, as well as possible outliers. The boxplot is useful for identifying scatter and skewness in data, as well as detecting outliers.


### Scatter Plot
A scatter plot, or Scatter Plot, is a visual representation of data that uses **points to represent the values of two different variables**. Each point on the graph 
represents an observation in the data set and its position on the x and y axis indicates the values of the two variables. Scatterplots are useful 
for identifying patterns, trends, and relationships between variables in a data set. They are especially useful for showing the correlation between two variables.
