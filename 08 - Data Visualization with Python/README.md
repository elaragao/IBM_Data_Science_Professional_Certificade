# Data Visualization with Python


## Summary :memo:
In this course, many ways to effectively visualize small and large scale data were demonstrated. It presented ways of taking data that at first glance has little meaning and presenting it in a way that conveys insights.

This course showed you ways to work with many data visualization tools and techniques. Various types of basic and advanced graphs and tables have been created, such as: waffle graphs, area graphs, histograms, bar graphs, pie graphs, scatter plots, word clouds, choropleth maps and many others. Interactive dashboards have also been created that will allow even those without any experience in data science to better understand the data and make more effective and informed decisions.

## Key Skills Learned :key:
 - Implement data visualization techniques and graphs using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.
 - Create different types of graphs and plots such as line, area, histograms, bar, pie, box, scatter and bubble
 - Create advanced visualizations such as waffle graphs, word clouds, regression graphs, bullet maps, and choropleth maps
 - Generate interactive dashboards containing scatter, line, bar, bubble, pie, and sunburst charts using the Dash framework and Plotly library
