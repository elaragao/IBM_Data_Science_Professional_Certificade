### Waffle Chart
A waffle chart is a form of data visualization that uses a grid of squares to represent the proportional distribution of a categorical variable. 
Each square in the grid represents a unit or fixed proportion of the variable in question. The color or filling of the squares is often used to indicate different 
categories. Waffle charts are useful for communicating proportions and percentages in a visually appealing and intuitive way, especially when it comes to comparing 
parts of a whole. They are often used in reports, presentations, and infographics to illustrate the composition of data in an easy-to-understand way.

### Word Cloud
A Word Cloud is a form of data visualization that highlights the most frequent words in a body of text, where the size of each word is proportional to its 
frequency of occurrence. Words are typically displayed in a random arrangement or in an arrangement that forms a cloud. The most common words are often displayed 
in a larger or bold font to draw more attention. Word clouds are often used to summarize and visualize the essence of a text or to quickly identify predominant themes 
in large sets of text data. They are popular in sentiment analysis, customer feedback analysis, article summaries and speeches, among others.
