### Relational Database
When data is stored in tabular form, the data is organized in tables like in a spreadsheet, which is columns and rows, that's relational database. The columns contain properties about the item such as LastName, FirstName, e-mail address, city. A table is a collection of related things, like a list of employees or a list of book authors. In a relational database, you can form relationships between tables.

It provides an interface for users and applications to interact with data in an organized and efficient manner, ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency. Examples of DBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database and Microsoft SQL Server.

### RDBMS
RDBMS, or Relational Database Management System, is a specific type of DBMS that organizes data into tables related to each other using primary and foreign keys. RDBMS serves as the backbone of applications in many industries, including banking, transportation, health, and so on. Examples are: MySQL, Oracle Database, IBM DB2, etc.
